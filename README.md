# Conways-game-of-life
The classic game of life. It's very poorly optimized and will lag.

Left click to place living cells, right click to remove living cells. Press space to run the simulation and pause the simulation. You can edit the current state while paused.

You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel, but don't use that feature.
